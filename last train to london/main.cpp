Burn, baby burn,
Burn, baby burn,
Burn, baby burn,
Burn, baby burn.
Burning
To my surprise,
One hundred stories high
People getting loose now,
Getting down on the roof
I heard somebody say
(Burn baby burn) Disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) I Burn that mother down
(Burn baby burn) Disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) I Burn that mother down... Burnin'
I never can say goodbye,
No no no I...
I never can say goodbye
Everytime I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right to the core
It says
Turn around you fool
You know you love him more and more
Tell me why (tell me why)
Is it so
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye Boy
Uooh baby
I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, uh uh
Su la mani cosi, yahoo!

Everyone around the world
Come on!
Relight my fire,
Your love is my only desire
Relight my fire
Cos I need your love
Baby,
Do you understand me now?
Sometimes I feel a little mad
But, don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad
'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Oh! Oh! Ooh! Yeah! yeah! yeah! uh! uh!
Aaahh Freak out!
Le Freak, c'est chic

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh the night is my world
City life painted girls
In a day nothing matters
It's the night time that flatters
You take my self you take my self control
You got me livin' only for the night
Before the morning comes the story's told
You take my self you take my self control
I I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight against a new tomorrow
So I guess i just believe it that tomorrow never knows
Jungle life
You're far away from nothing
It's all right
You won't miss home
Take a chance
Leave everything behind you
Come and join me Won't be sorry
It's easy to survive
Jungle life We're living in the open
All alone like Tarzan Boy
Hide and seek
We play along while rushing cross the
Forest Monkey business on a sunny afternoon
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Navighiamo già da un po',
Bene o male non lo so,
Stella guida gli occhi tuoi,
Un amore grande
Noi peschiamo nella fantasia
Pietre verdi di Bahia?
Al timone la follia
E ci ritroviamo, in alto mare
In alto mare
Per poi lasciarsi andare
Sull'onda che ti butta giù
E poi ti scaglia verso il blu
E respirare
In alto mare
Come due uccelli da ammazzare
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oho, hu hu, hu hu, hu!
Downtown's been caught by the hysteria, People scream and shout
A generation's on the move
When disco spreads like a bacteria
These lonely days are out
Welcome the passion of the groove
The golden years, The silver tears
You wore a tie like Richard Gere
I wanna get down You spin me around
I stand on the borderline, Crying at the discoteque
Oh oh oh Crying at the discoteque oh oh hu!
I saw you crying
I saw you crying at the discoteque
I saw you crying
I saw you crying at the discoteque
Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name
She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire At your desire
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire At your desire, hoo!
Sittin' here eatin' my heart out waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone off the wall
Lookin' for some hot stuff baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
I want some hot stuff baby this evenin'
Gotta have some hot stuff
Gotta have some love tonight
I need hot stuff
I don't know
Why you're not there
I give you my love, but you don't care
So what is right,
And what is wrong Gimme a sign!
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me,
Don't hurt me,
No more
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me,
Don't hurt me,
No more
Uoh uoh uoh uoh
Uoh uoh uoh uoh
Oh!
Uoh uoh uoh uoh
Uoh uoh uoh
Ooooooooh! (This is the rhythm of the night)
The night, oh yeah
The rhythm of the night
This is the rhythm of my life
My life, oh yeah
The rhythm of my life
Won't you teach me how to love and learn
There'll be nothing left for me to yearn
Think of me and burn, and let me hold your hand, hoo!
I don't wanna face the world in tears
Please think again, I'm on my knees
Sing that song to me, no reason to repent
I know you wanna say it
This is the rhythm of the night
The night, ancora, oh yeah, cosi!
The rhythm of the night
This is the rhythm of my life
My life, oh yeah
The rhythm of my life, life, life
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Rumore rumore eh eh
Na na na na na na
Na na na non mi sento sicura, sicura,
Sicura mai
Na na na na na na
Io stasera vorrei
Tornare indietro con il tempo
Na na
E ritornare al tempo Che c'eri tu
Però perciò Che non pensarci più su
Ma ritornare, ritornare perchè
Quando ho deciso che facevo da me!
Cuore, batticuore
Na na na na na
Mi è sembrato di sentire un rumore, rumore
Eh Sera da paura
Io da sola non mi sento sicura, sicura
Sicura mai
Cosi cosi cosi cosi!
We were born to be,
Alive
We were born to be,
Alive
Born,
Born
Born to be alive
(Born to be alive)
Yes we were born,
Born,
Born,
Born... to be alive
People ask me why I never find a place to stop and settle
Down down down
We were born to be alive
A suitcase and an old guitar and something new to occupy my mind mind mind
Yes we were born to be alive
Yes we were born,
Born born to be alive
(Born to be alive)
Yes we were born
Born
Born
Born to be alive
It's good to be alive
It's good to be alive
It's good to be alive
It's good to be alive
And we were born
To be alive
And we were born
To be alive
To be alive
Cosi?
All the old paintings on the tombs
They do the sand dance don't you know
If they move too quick
(Oh whey oh)
They're falling down like a domino
All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles
(Oh whey oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say Ay oh whey oh, oy oh whey oh
Walk like an Egyptian, Cosi
Walk like an Egyptian
Su, su l'mani
I got chills, they're multiplyin',
And I'm losin' control
Cause the power you're supplyin', it's electrifyin'
You better shape up,
Cause I need a man,
To my heart I must be true
Nothing left, nothing left for me to do
You're the one that I want
(You are the one I want),
Ooh ooh ooh, honey!
The one that I want
(You are the one I want),
Ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one I need (the one I need),
Oh yes indeed (yes indeed)
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
They have everything for you men to enjoy,
You can hang out with all the boys
YMCA
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
You can get yourself cleaned, you can have a good meal,
You can do whatever you feel
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
